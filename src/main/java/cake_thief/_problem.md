You are a renowned thief who has recently switched from stealing precious metals to stealing cakes because of the insane profit margins. You end up hitting the jackpot, breaking into the world's largest privately owned stock of cakesâ€”the vault of the Queen of England.

While Queen Elizabeth has a limited number of types of cake, she has an unlimited supply of each type.

Each type of cake has a weight and a value, stored in objects of a CakeType class

You brought a duffel bag that can hold limited weight, and you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.

Write a method `maxDuffelBagValue()` that takes an array of cake type objects and a weight capacity, and returns the maximum monetary value the duffel bag can hold.
